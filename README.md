# column_distillation
Column Distillation using Mccabe Thiele diagram, and thermodynamic features of distillation

Two different functions work together to find optimal condition for a column distillation setup.

## SP_OpeTemp:
Finds different seperation factors of a binary mixture on a operation temperature range given by [start, finish].
As well as operation temperature as a function of average pressure in the distillation column to find realistic setting values.

## vapLiqSP:
On differing seperation factor creates a Mccabe Thiele diagram and prints out all significant values as:  
* Feed tray location
* Minimum number of plates
* Optimal Reflux Ratio
* Number of theoretical plates (without reboiler)
